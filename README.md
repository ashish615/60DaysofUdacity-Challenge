### Day 10 - Saturday, 6th July

- Learning Backpropogation.

### Day 11 - Monday, 8th July
- **Missed a Day but now I'm back on track**
- Completed Backpropogation. Practiced a lot by differentiating equations by hand.
- Started learning how to scrape the web using _BeautifulSoup_.

### Day 12 - Tuesday, 9th July
- Started exploring the [CO2 emmissions from Fossil Fuels](https://datahub.io/core/co2-fossil-by-nation) dataset. Will understand the data for a few days then try forecasting, may even use encrypted deep learning to make things interesting.
- Started learning *Dimensionality Reduction*.
